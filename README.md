Utilizes: React.js, jwt Token based login system 

The main idea is to make some sort of a twitter clone.

Backend is available at the repo - https://github.com/TadasKuzminskas/ReactiveWebSpringSecurity

Both applications are under development

This is a training application for my own education purposes and I would not advise taking this code as a reference.
